This project implements a simple version of Yao's Garbled Circuits with a corresponding implementation of Oblivious Transfer (OT). These cryptographic primitives are foundational in the realm of secure multi-party computation (SMPC), enabling two parties to collaboratively compute a function over their inputs while keeping the inputs private.

## Oblivious Transfer
**Oblivious transfer**__ is a cryptographic protocol essential for secure multi-party computation. It allows a receiver to select one of two messages from a sender without revealing their choice to the sender, and the receiver learns nothing about the unselected message. Here are the steps for how it works:

1. **Message Preparation:** The sender prepares 2 messages, m<sub>0</sub> and m<sub>1</sub>.
2. **Key Exchange:**
3. **Shared Keys:**
4. **Message Encryption:**
5. **Decryption:**
